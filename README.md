# Popeye

Popeye is a chess position evaluator/analyser that was developed with help of Deep Learning.
You can use Popeye whether if you want to play chess for fun or analyse your games in order to improve your chess skills

Further details about the implementation can be found both in our PDF documentation and in our ppt presentation

---

# Technologies

Popeye was developed using a client-sever web application having its backend written in Django Rest Framework and its frontend in Angular

---

# Useful commands

In order to run Popeye you must first have installed both technologies used.
Then you should pull this repository on your own machine and start both backend and frontend applications.

In order to run our backend execute the following:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver 8080
````
And to run our frontend execute the following:

````
ng serve
````
Both our backend and frontend will run on localhost unless you explicitly tell them not to.

---
Now you should be able to play a lovely game of chess.

# Have fun!
